Overview of Your Project Files
anagram.js:

Likely contains a function that checks if two strings are anagrams (words or phrases that can be rearranged to form each other).
You would have a corresponding test file anagram.test.js to verify this functionality.
chunk.js:

Probably contains a function to break an array into smaller chunks of a specified size.
A test file (chunk.test.js) would be used to ensure this function behaves as expected.
functions.js:

A general file that may contain various utility functions.
Your test file (functions.test.js) would contain tests for each function inside this module.
reversestring.js:

Contains a function that reverses a string input.
The corresponding test file (reversestring.test.js) would test this functionality.
package.json & package-lock.json:

These files manage your project's dependencies, including Jest, and any other libraries you're using for development and testing.
node_modules:

A directory where all installed dependencies (including Jest) are stored. You don't need to interact directly with this directory.


Summary
Each .js file corresponds to a specific functionality.
You have test files (e.g., anagram.test.js, chunk.test.js) that verify the correctness of your code.
Using Jest helps you ensure each function performs as expected, catching bugs early.
